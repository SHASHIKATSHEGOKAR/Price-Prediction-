# Linear Regression for Future Price Prediction

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of Linear Regression for predicting future prices based on historical data.

## Description

Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm that models the relationship between a target variable (future prices) and independent variables (features) like historical price data or market indicators.

## How it Works

1. **Data Collection**: Gather historical price data and relevant features.

2. **Data Preparation**: Preprocess and clean the data.

3. **Model Building**: Train a Linear Regression model using historical data.

4. **Prediction**: Use the model to predict future prices based on new data.

## Usage

1. **Dataset**: Prepare your historical price dataset or find a suitable dataset.

2. **Training**: Train a Linear Regression model using the dataset.

3. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to predict future prices.
